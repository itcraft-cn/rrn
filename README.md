# rrn: regex-repalce-name

[Chinese version](README_cn.md)

batch rename files/dirs by regex.

Tribute to [f2](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/). 

Currently, it has an issue [#120](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/issues/120) which it cannot replace filenames or folders containing spaces. 

However, this is a common usage scenario. As a temporary solution, I've created a small tool to address this. 

It's just a simple toy.
